# How Flada works?

+ Set up your profile and import all social media profiles which you want to share in a meeting.
+ Rather sharing information verbally in meetings you can simply give your username to the other person. He/She then can request your card.
+ Share your card instantly!
+ Best part, these cards are saved offline.
